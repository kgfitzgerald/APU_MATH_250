<!-- ### Project comments -->

<!-- - If you haven't already, make sure to save your clean data as a .RDS file (e.g. using `saveRDS()`), and place it in your `data` folder. Your written report should start by reading in this data file.  -->
<!-- - Check out [from Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com) website for suggestions on creative visualizations to use (includes R code!) -->
<!-- - Don't need to run every imaginable analysis on your data, but do want you to demonstrate a thorough investigation of your dataset.  -->
<!--     + What insight can you glean from these data?  -->
<!--     + What (interesting) questions can be answered from these data? -->
<!--     + Should do more exploring than what ends up in your final report  -->
<!--     + Explore to death - become an expert on these data!  -->
<!-- - May want to create a new file called `analysis.qmd` for all the analyses you're going to explore that may or may not end up in your written report.  -->
<!-- - Comment your code - someone else should be able to follow exactly what your code is doing and why -->
<!-- - Start creating a codebook that describes what each variable in your dataset is -->
<!-- - Tips on multiple linear regression: -->
<!--     + To choose a "best" model, use `regsubsets()` function from `leaps` package (see 4th set of slides from Week 08) -->
<!--     + Don't forget to check for model diagnostics at the end (see 3rd & 4th set of slides from Week 08) -->
