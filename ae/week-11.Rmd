### Announcements

+ Today: continue working on Lab 08, due class-time Thursday
+ Thursday: project work session
+ Rough draft due next Tuesday at midnight, early submission encouraged
    + Will read two groups' reports prior to class that Thursday


### Project comments

- Make sure to save your clean data as a .RDS file (e.g. using `saveRDS()`), and place it in your `data` folder. 
- Check out [from Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com) website for suggestions on creative visualizations to use (includes R code!)
- Don't need to run every imaginable analysis on your data, but do want you to demonstrate a thorough investigation of your dataset. 
    + What insight can you glean from these data? 
    + What (interesting) questions can be answered from these data?
    + Should do more exploring than what ends up in your final report 
    + Explore to death - become an expert on these data! 
- Comment your code and/or provide narrative
- Use good coding practices (e.g. use of white space, line breaks)
- May want to create a new file called `analysis.qmd` for all the analyses you're going to explore that may or may not end up in your written report. 
- Provide a codebook that describes what each variable in your dataset is

    
### Questions?



### Application Exercise

- The remainder of class will be spent on AE-09. 
- You can access it from GitHub. 
- It is due at the end of class today.
