### Questions?

+ The difference between the log odds, regular odds, and the probability are still a little confusing. I think the log odds are just the logit function equation and then the regular odds are 1/(1+exp(x)) and the probability is exp(odds)/(1 + exp(odds)). Is that correct or did I mix something up?

    + log-odds is another name for the logit function, and it's the scale the regression output is provided on
    + we exponentiate to get the odds
    + we solve for p to get the probability
    
    
$$\text{ log odds: } \ \ \ logit(p) = log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) \equiv x$$

$$\text{odds: } \ \ \ exp(x) = \frac{p}{1-p}$$

$$\text{probability: } \ \ \ p = \frac{e^{x}}{1 + e^{x}}$$

+ We saw that we needed to fit a logistic regression model if the thing we were trying to predict was a categorical variable and a linear regression model if we are trying to predict a numeric variable. Does it matter what kind of variables the predictors themselves are though?

+ Comments for peers about group work:

    + "Please don't be immediately opposed to work or ideas that are not your own. Everyone could have something to contribute if they are allowed!"
    + "I feel like my group has been very last minute in regards to our project so punctuality is something we have to work on."
    
### Application Exercise

- The remainder of class will be spent on AE-08. 
- You can access it from your RStudio Cloud account. 
- It is due by class-time on Thursday. 
- To turn it in, you should upload your .html file to Canvas.
