### Citation management

-   Download & Install [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions)

-   Download & Install [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)

-   Install the [Zotero Connector for Chrome](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors)

-   Install [Better BibTeX for Zotero](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/)

-   See `Zotero_demo.qmd` on GitHub (and `references.bib`) for demo of citations in Quarto

-   Open Microsoft Word on your computer and look for the [Zotero tab](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage)

-   Open a Google Doc (in Chrome) and look for the [Zotero tab](https://www.zotero.org/support/google_docs)

Citation tasks:

1.  In Chrome, search for and locate the sources you plan to cite, and click on the Extensions puzzle piece to add them to your Zotero library

    1.  If they are just websites rather than academic papers or books, you may need to manually edit the citation info in Zotero

2.  In a Quarto file (e.g. your written report), create (potentially placeholder) sentences with in-text citations (Insert \> \@ Citation), then Render.

3.  OPTIONAL: Repeat the citation process in Word (or Google Docs)

### Questions?

### Rough Draft Peer Review

Why peer review?

-   Giving good feedback is a skill (that we don't often practice)

-   Receiving and incorporating feedback effectively also takes practice

-   Our work is better when we have multiple perspectives speak into it

-   It's one of the only cures to the curse of expertise!

-   Makes us better at self-assessing our own work

-   It's part of the scientific process

Logistics:

-   (15 mins) In your project groups, discuss assigned paper and fill out the "SHORT Rough Draft Peer Feedback - Group X" form in the shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/190TgJca5qleOGoQQMJ6IbLj_RbSRKtOE?usp=share_link) (located in the folder of the group you're reviewing)

-   (15 mins) Pair up with the group and exchange feedback (\~7 mins per group)

-   Remainder of class will be spent on working on your FORMAL review (this is graded and counts towards your final project grade!)

+-----------+--------------------+
|           | Group pairings     |
+===========+====================+
| Session 1 | Group 1 & Group 3  |
|           |                    |
|           | Group 2 & Group 4  |
|           |                    |
|           | Group 5 & Dr. Fitz |
+-----------+--------------------+

For the group you did NOT already exchange feedback with, you will write up a FORMAL peer review

-   Group 1 formally reviews Group 2
-   Group 2 formally reviews Group 3
-   Group 3 formally reviews Group 4
-   Group 4 formally reviews Group 5
-   Group 5 formally reviews Group 1

Your formal review will include:

-   FORMAL evaluation rubric filled out (Written report section ONLY) (in the folder of the group you're reviewing)
-   A brief write-up (\~1 page) highlighting the following:
    -   A summary of the research questions, data context, and findings, as you understand them
    -   Brief comments on strengths of the paper
    -   Constructive criticism, raising questions / points of confusion, and outlining what needs to be changed/improved in order for the report to be exemplary

The constructive criticism should make up the bulk of the 1-page review. Remember: the goal is to help them IMPROVE the work. You should NOT simply tell them it's wonderful, and you should NOT simply criticize without offering concrete suggestions for HOW to improve.

### Thursday - Shiny Part I

-   For AE-11, you will complete Lessons 03 - 05 from the [Shiny Getting Started Tutorials](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson3/)

-   You will turn in a .zip folder that includes the `lesson-03` and `census-app` folders as well as the .Rproj file from your Shiny project
