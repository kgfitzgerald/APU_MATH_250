### Announcements


### Thursday - Shiny Part I

-   For AE-11, you will complete Lessons 03 - 05 from the [Shiny Getting Started Tutorials](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson3/)

-   You will turn in a .zip folder that includes the `lesson-03` and `census-app` folders as well as the .Rproj file from your Shiny project



### Questions?

### Rough Draft Peer Review

Why peer review?

-   Giving good feedback is a skill (that we don't often practice)

-   Receiving and incorporating feedback effectively also takes practice

-   Our work is better when we have multiple perspectives speak into it

-   Makes us better at self-assessing our own work

-   It's part of the scientific process

We will do the following twice:

-   (10 mins) In your project groups, discuss assigned paper and fill out feedback form in the shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/190TgJca5qleOGoQQMJ6IbLj_RbSRKtOE?usp=share_link) ("Peer feedback for Group X")

-   (15 mins) Pair up with the group and exchange feedback (\~7 mins per group)

### General Tips

-   Hide code in final report (can have code chunk with `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)` at the top of your .qmd)

-   Think about audience:

    -   Generally educated stakeholder - not necessarily an analyst

    -   The .qmd can have thorough commenting for an analyst to follow, but don't need to include all the analysis/coding decisions in the report itself

    -   Avoid heavy jargon (both statistical and R-related)

-   Focus more on commentary of your results and what they mean, less on analysis/coding decisions

-   Use spellcheck :)

-   Use "English" in your table headers - rather than the raw column headers
