### Shiny Part II 

+ For AE-12, you will design and implement a Shiny app to explore your project data

+ These should be completed in your shared Group Project workspace 

+ Begin by sketching out an idea on paper

+ When ready to start building your app, you should create a new folder in your project directory called `shiny` and place all necessary files there

+ You will turn in a .zip file of the `shiny` folder as well as the `.Rproj` file. Make sure any necessary data is included and in an appropriate file structure in the .zip folder as well so that the app can be run on someone else's computer.
