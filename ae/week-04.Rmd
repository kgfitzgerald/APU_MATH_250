<!-- ### Thursday Announcements -->

<!-- -   2 Stats Experience Points due Saturday -->
<!-- -   Sign up for project groups on Canvas by class-time on Tuesday -->
<!--     -   choose your own groups of 2 -->
<!--     -   who will you work well with? -->
<!--     -   who do you have common (data) interests with? Check out initial Campuswire responses -->

<!-- What's ahead: -->

<!-- -   Weeks 1 - 4, foundational coding techniques -->
<!-- -   Weeks 5 - 7, Exam/Start Projects/Ethics -->
<!-- -   Weeks 8 - 11, statistical analysis techniques -->
<!-- -   Weeks 12 - 15, communicating results / Projects -->
<!-- -   Only 4 more labs (after Lab 04), 7 project work sessions -->

### Announcements

- Due Thursday: Lab 03, Project Brainstorm post, (no annotations this week)
- First 2 Stats Experience Points due Saturday (remember to post brief reflection on Canvas)
  -   [Informational Interview resource](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ESP_xm-kXo3gsRrzmbG0XR37yRqnMCT5TiqPli6Pnc/edit?usp=sharing)
   -   [Appointment slots](https://calendar.app.google/vciEZtXbBiz4aEWP7) for dinner with me after class
   -   Exam 1 in-class next Thursday, will have take-home component due the following Tuesday

### Questions / tips from Weekly Check-in

+ "helpful during ae/lab when we are given guidance about how particular functions can help us... for example, I've learned `glimpse()`, `?` and `install.packages()`... I'm going to start keeping a record of things I learn during AEs or labs so I can look back on them moving forward"

+ "Can we go over the order in which we should intend to start a code?"

+ Lots of people (inside and outside this class) asking for prayer for balancing lots of commitments / heavy workload. Tips to share? 

### Tidyverse style guidelines

[Tidyverse style guidelines](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) for line breaks, white space, etc.

1.  Have space before `|>` and a linebreak after

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
iris |>
  group_by(Species) |>
  summarize_if(is.numeric, mean) |>
  ungroup() |>
  gather(measure, value, -Species) |>
  arrange(value)

# Bad
iris |> group_by(Species) |> summarize_all(mean) |>
ungroup |> gather(measure, value, -Species) |>
arrange(value)
```

2.  `ggplot()` layers each go on their own line, space before `+`, all but first layer indented.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Sepal width, in cm",
    y = "Sepal length, in cm",
    title = "Sepal length vs. width of irises"
  ) 

# Bad
ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species))+
  geom_point() + labs(x = "Sepal width, in cm", y = "Sepal length, in cm", title = "Sepal length vs. width of irises") 
```

3.  If arguments to a function don't fit on one line, put each argument on its own line

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iris |>
  group_by(Species) |>
  summarise(
    Sepal.Length = mean(Sepal.Length),
    Sepal.Width = mean(Sepal.Width),
    Species = n_distinct(Species)
  )

iris |>
  group_by(Species) |>
  summarise(Sepal.Length = mean(Sepal.Length),
            Sepal.Width = mean(Sepal.Width),
            Species = n_distinct(Species))
```

4.  Spaces on each side of all operators (e.g. `+, =, &, <-,`) and after commas

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
iris |> 
  mutate(ratio = Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point()

# Bad
iris|> 
  mutate(ratio=Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=Sepal.Width,y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Application Exercise

-   The remainder of class will be spent on AE-04.
-   You can access it from GitHub.
-   It is due at the end of class today.
-   To turn it in, you should upload your .html file to Canvas.
