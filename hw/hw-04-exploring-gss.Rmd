The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes.
Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972.
In addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years.

The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioural, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest.
Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.

In this assignment we analyze data from the 2016 GSS, using it to estimate values of population parameters of interest about US adults.[^hw-08-exploring-gss-1]

# Getting started

This homework assignment will be completed *individually*. To get started,

+ Login to your RStudio Cloud account
+ Access the `MATH_250_individual` workspace 
+ Launch the `Homework 04` project
+ Open `hw-04.qmd`

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation and the data lives in the **dsbox** package.
These packages are already installed for you.
You can load them by running the following in your Console:

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dsbox)
```

## Data

The data can be found in the **dsbox** package, and it's called `gss16`.
Since the dataset is distributed with the package, we don't need to load it separately; it becomes available to us when we load the package.
You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation, which you can access by running `?gss16` in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio to search for `gss16`.
You can also find this information [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/gss16.html).

# Exercises

## Part 1: Harassment at work

In 2016, the GSS added a new question on harassment at work.
The question is phrased as the following.

> *Over the past five years, have you been harassed by your superiors or co-workers at your job, for example, have you experienced any bullying, physical or psychological abuse?*

Answers to this question are stored in the `harass5` variable in our dataset.

1.  What are the possible responses to this question and how many respondents chose each of these answers?

2.  What percent of the respondents for whom this question is applicable\
    (i.e. excluding `NA`s and `Does not apply`s) have been harassed by their superiors or co-workers at their job.

## Part 2: Time spent on email

The 2016 GSS also asked respondents how many hours and minutes they spend on email weekly.
The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables.
For example, if the response is 2.5 hrs, this would be recorded as `emailhr = 2` and `emailmin = 30`.

3.  Create a new variable called `email` that combines these two variables to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.

4.  Visualize the distribution of this new variable.
    Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly.
    Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical among of time Americans spend on email weekly?
    Why?

5.  Create another new variable, `snap_insta` that is coded as "Yes" if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and "No" if not.
    If the recorded value was `NA` for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be `NA`.

6.  Calculate the percentage of Yes's for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding `NA`s.

7.  What are the possible responses to the question *Last week were you working full time, part time, going to school, keeping house, or what?* and how many respondents chose each of these answers?
    Note that this information is stored in the `wrkstat` variable.

8.  Fit a model predicting `email` (number of minutes per week spent on email) from `educ` (number of years of education), `wrkstat`, and `snap_insta`.
    Interpret the slopes for each of these variables.

9.  Create a predicted values vs. residuals plot for this model.
    Are there any issues with the model?
    If yes, describe them.

# Submission

Before submitting, open up your .html in a full window and inspect the following:

+ Check your code for neatness - add spaces and line breaks where appropriate to improve readability

+ Check any visualizations for informative and clean labels and titles

+ Check any tables for clean formatting (e.g. with `kbl() %>% kable_minmal()`)

+ Check that you've interpreted output as appropriate

+ Make sure extraneous warnings and messages are suppressed (e.g. set warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

+ Check that Exercises are clearly labeled and your text responses are visually distinguished

+ Check for overall neatness & organization of the report (e.g. headers, subheaders, use of bullets, font changes)

To submit, you need to export your .html document from RStudio Cloud and then upload it to the HW 04 assignment on Canvas. Refer back to [Lab 01](https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/APU_MATH_250/labs/lab-01-hello-r.html) for detailed instructions on how to export and submit your assignment.

| Workflow & formatting   | 5      |

**Grading notes**:

-   The "Workflow & formatting" grade is to assess the reproducible workflow. This includes having readable code (e.g. adequate use of spacing and line breaks), labeled code chunks, informative headers and sub-headers, and an overall organized and uncluttered report (e.g. suppress messages & warnings, no extraneous output).
