# Doing the Right Thing

> Ethics is the study of what it means to 'do the right thing.' 
> Sara Basse, *A Gift of Fire*

But how do we know what is "the right thing"?

# Multiple Approaches

There are 3 approaches to determining the "right thing" often found in
ethics textbooks.

One is the **deontological approach** or framework. This framework is
based on a set of rules such as company rules, government rules, or
religious rules such as the Ten Commandments. If the action in question
adheres to the rules, it is considered to be the right thing to do in
that context.

Another common approach uses the **utilitarian framework**. There are
many varieties of this approach, but the basic idea is that the right
thing to do is the thing that brings the most utility, or happiness, to
the most people. While the action may help some and hurt others, if the
benefits to some outweigh the costs to others, the action is “the right
thing.”

The third framework, **virtue ethics**, takes a completely different
approach—it examines the background of our moral decisions and actions.
For example, it asks how a person who is generous will see a situation
and its moral demands differently from someone who is greedy. The "right
thing to do" is the thing that would be chosen by the virtuous person.

Virtue ethics is often the easiest framework to initially grasp. Most of
us have at least one person that we admire for making wise choices. This
assignment begins with thinking about ethics by considering the virtues
that that wise person might have to enable their wise decisions.

# Moral Heroes Exercise

In her book *Glittering Vices* [-@DeYoung:2020], Rebecca DeYoung defines virtues as
"excellence of character, habits or dispositions of character that help
us live well as excellent human beings." Using courage as an example of
a virtue, she explains, "A courageous friend stands up for us when our
reputation is unfairly maligned, despite the risk to his own personal or
professional reputation."

In addition to generosity and courage, here are some commonly-listed
virtues:

## Questions

1. In your own words, describe the meaning of "virtue".

2. Who is the wisest, most virtuous, morally admirable person you know?

    a. What virtues would you say characterize them?
Name at least 5-6 of them. (Use your own terms OR choose from the
virtue list above.)

    b. Now try to rank those virtues in order of their importance. Does
    your hero have a “signature” or “defining” virtue that captures
    their overall character?

    c. Can you tell a story that illustrates *why* this person is
    admirable or showcases what you mean by a particular
    virtue-attribution?

3. Respond to the following :

> It is often said that the same data can be used to support a
        variety of conclusions. Suppose your moral hero was a data
        analyst who was asked to present data (using statistics,
        graphs, etc) in a way that supported a policy change that her
        company (and the analyst herself) thought would have a very
        positive impact on society. However, to do so, she would not
        be choosing what she truly believed was the most accurate
        presentation method. What would she do and why? (which
        virtue(s) previously ascribed to this individual would
        influence her decision?)

4. Consider the descriptions of the other two ethics frameworks
    described in the introduction to the assignment. Do you think that
    one of them would work better than virtue ethics for deciding the
    scenario above? If so, state that framework and give a
    brief description of how you would apply it to make the decision.
    If not, explain why neither of the other frameworks would be
    helpful.
