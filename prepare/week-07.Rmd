Week 07 will follow a different format, since we will be spending the whole week doing a deep dive into Data Ethics. 

## For Tuesday, October 10

`r emo::ji("memo")` **A first look at Ethics:** Read [this "ethics lab"](https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/APU_MATH_250/prepare/week-07-ethics-lab.html) and take some time to answer the questions. You do not need to turn in your answers, but you should write them down (or type them). You will be discussing your reflections in groups during class on Tuesday.
