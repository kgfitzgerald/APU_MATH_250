# Case study: MLB batting performance

## Case study: MLB batting performance

We would like to discern whether there are real differences between the batting performance of baseball players according to their position: outfielder (OF), infielder (IF), and catcher (C). We will use a dataset called mlb_players_18, which includes batting records of 429 Major League Baseball (MLB) players from the 2018 season who had at least 100 at bats. 

--

+ How many variables? **2**
+ What type(s) of variable(s)? **numerical, categorical (3+ levels)**

--

This is an **(dichotomous) decision** question, meaning a hypothesis test is most appropriate. 

Note: now our categorical variable has more than two levels! So we are comparing **many means**, rather than a difference in two means. 

---

## ANOVA: Analysis of Variance

ANOVA is the statistical method for comparing many means

$$H_0: \mu_{OF} = \mu_{IF} = \mu_C$$
$$H_A: \text{at least one mean differs from the others}$$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mlb <- mlb_players_18 %>%
  filter(
    AB >= 100, 
    !position %in% c("P", "DH")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    position = case_when(
      position %in% c("LF", "CF", "RF")       ~ "OF",
      position %in% c("1B", "2B", "3B", "SS") ~ "IF",
      TRUE                                    ~ position
    ),
    position = fct_relevel(position, "OF", "IF", "C")
  )
```
.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
mlb %>% 
  group_by(position) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            mean = mean(OBP),
            sd = sd(OBP))
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(mlb, aes(x = position, y = OBP)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
]

ANOVA asks: is the variability in sample means so large that is seems unlikely to be from chance alone?

## ANOVA Logic / Test Statistic

Total variability in Y = Variability BETWEEN groups + Variability WITHIN groups

--

MSB = mean square between groups $\sum_{j = 1}^k\frac{(\overline{Y}_j - \overline{Y}_{\cdot})^2}{k - 1}$

MSE = mean square within groups (mean square error) $\sum_{i = 1}^{n_j}\frac{(\overline{Y}_{ij} - \overline{Y}_{j})^2}{n_j - 1}$

--

When $H_0$ is true, $MSB \approx MSE$, but when $H_A$ is true, $MSB > MSE$

--

Statistical theory tells us when $H_0$ is true (all the means are equal),

$$F = \frac{MSB}{MSE} \sim F(k - 1, n - k),$$

where $k$ is the number of groups and $n$ is the (total) sample size $(n = \sum_{j = 1}^k n_j)$.

## F-distribution

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/F-distribution_pdf.svg")
```

---

## ANOVA in R

Syntax is similar to fitting a regression model.

```{r}
mlb_model <- lm(OBP ~ position, data = mlb)
anova(mlb_model)
```

---

## ANOVA in R

.pull-left[
```{r}
tidy(anova(mlb_model))
qf(.99, 2, 426) #critical value
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height="50%"}
anova_results <- tidy(anova(mlb_model))
stat <-  anova_results[1,5] %>% pull()
df1 <- anova_results[1,2] %>% pull()
df2 <- anova_results[2,2] %>% pull()
crit_value99 <- qf(.99, df1, df2)

ggplot() +
  xlim(c(0,8)) + 
  stat_slab(aes(y = "F",
                   dist = dist_f(df1 = df1, df2 = df2),
                   fill = after_stat(x > stat)),
               show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = crit_value99, linewidth = 1, linetype = 21,
             color = "navyblue") +
  annotate("label", label = "0.01 Critical\nValue", 
           x = crit_value99, y = 2, color = "navyblue") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = stat, linewidth = 1, linetype = 19,
             color = "purple") +
  annotate("label", label = "Test\nStatistic", 
           x = stat, y = 2.25, color = "purple") +
  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE, ylim = c(0.9, 2.5)) +
  labs(y = "", x = "x") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme_minimal()
```

]


$$H_0: \mu_{OF} = \mu_{IF} = \mu_C$$

We REJECT H0. There is sufficient evidence to claim that batting performance differs by position.

## Assumptions for ANOVA

+ Independence (satisfied if random sample)
+ Approximately normal (satisfied if sample size large enough per group)
+ Constant variance: variance in groups is about equal from one group to the next (examine side-by-side boxplot)

Independence is always important. Normality is important in small sample sizes. Constant variance important when sample sizes differ between groups.

---

# How is this different from linear regression?

```{r}
mlb_model <- lm(OBP ~ position, data = mlb)
summary(mlb_model)
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
classdata <- classdata %>% 
  filter(lecture != "c")
```

When only comparing two groups (two-level categorical variable), two-sample t-test is equivalent to ANOVA F-test. In fact, $t^2 = F$, and the p-values will be identical.

```{r}
class_model <- lm(m1 ~ lecture, data = classdata)
tidy(summary(class_model))
tidy(anova(class_model))
```
