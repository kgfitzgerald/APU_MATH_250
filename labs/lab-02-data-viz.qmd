## Goals

In this lab, you will...

- Gain proficiency in data visualization
- Apply principles of effective data visualization to a real dataset
- Continue developing a workflow for reproducible data analysis.

## Getting started 

[INSERT INSTRUCTIONS HERE]

# Packages

We will work with the `tidyverse` package as usual. We will also use `viridis` and the `ggridges` packages.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
library(ggridges)
```

# Data: 2020 American National Election Study

The data for this homework assignment comes from the [2020 American National Election Study](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-time-series-study/).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
anes <- read_csv("data/anes2020_subset.csv")
```

A subset of variables are provided here. Some of them have been recoded, while others you may need to recode in order to be able to carry out your analysis. The variables are as follows:

- `CASEID`: a Case ID for the respondent.

- `hunt_fish`: a dummy variable asking if the respondent has gone hunting or fishing in the past year.

- `scientists`: A feeling thermometer question that asks how warmly respondents feel towards scientists. A score of 0 represents the coolest rating, while a score of 100 represents the warmest rating.

- `education`: An ordinal categorical representing the highest level of education for the respondent, ranging from less than high school to a professional degree.

- `ideology`: a seven point self-rating scale for the respondent’s ideology ranging from most liberal to most conservative

- `urbanrural`: a variable indicating how rural or urban the respondent’s home community is with four possible values: rural, small town, suburb, or city.

# Exercises 

All plots should follow the best visualization practices discussed in lecture. Plots should include an informative title, axes should be labeled, and careful consideration should be given to aesthetic choices.

Remember that continuing to develop a sound workflow for reproducible data analysis is important as you complete the lab and other assignments in this course. You should provide adequate comments to your code and narrative text interpreting your results.  

```{marginfigure}
For more details and code examples for histograms [ggplot2 reference page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html).
```

1. How many rows are in the `anes` dataset? How many columns? Please include code and output to support your response. 

2. Create a bar chart showing the `ideology` of the respondents, with the count on the y-axis. 
  - Please remember to include labels. 
  - What is the most common ideology? 
  - Do respondents tend to be moderate or more ideologically extreme?

3. Now, let’s examine whether ideologies are different based upon where people live. Please make a filled bar plot, showing one bar for each `ideology`, with the percentage of respondents on the y-axis going from 0-1, and the fill determined by `urbanrural`. 
  - You are encouraged but not required to use `viridis` colors. 
  - Please remember to include labels. 
  - Where do people of different ideologies tend to live? 
  - Does the percentage of non-responses (i.e., people who said NA) vary much by ideology?
  
4. How do people view scientists? Please make a histogram with the feeling thermometer on the x-axis and the number of respondents on the y-axis. Then, please comment on features of the histogram such as skewness and peaks.

5. Does the ideology of those who have gone hunting or fishing in the past year differ from those who haven’t? Please make side-by-side boxplots of these two groups.
  - You should start your code with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
anes %>%
  drop_na(hunt_fish) %>%
  mutate(hunted_fished = ifelse(hunt_fish == 0, "Did Not Hunt or Fish",  
                                "Hunted or Fished")) %>%
```







Then construct side-by-side ridgeline density plots using geom_density_ridge(). You can read more about ridgeline plots here.

Please describe what you observe in both plots and what you learn from one plot that you do not see in the other or that adds additional context to the other.

# Submission

To submit, you need to export your .pdf document from RStudio Cloud and then upload it to the Lab 02 assignment on Canvas. Refer back to [Lab 01](https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/APU_MATH_250/labs/lab-01-hello-r.html) for detailed instructions on how to export and submit your assignment. 

# Grading (50 pts)

<br>

| Component | Points |
|:----------|:-------|
| Ex 1      | 4      |
| Ex 2      | 6    |
| Ex 3      | 4    |
| Ex 4      | 8     |
| Ex 5      | 6      |
| Ex 6      | 6    |
| Ex 7      | 8    |
| Workflow & formatting   | 8      |

**Grading notes**:

-   The "Workflow & formatting" grade is to assess the reproducible workflow. This includes having readable code (e.g. adequate use of spacing and line breaks), labeled code chunks, informative headers and sub-headers, and an overall organized and uncluttered report (e.g. suppress messages & warnings, no extraneous output).
